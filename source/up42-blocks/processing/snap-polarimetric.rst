SNAP polarimetric block
=======================

Block type: ``PROCESSING``

This block provides a common polarimetric processing workflow with SNAP that operates ESA SAFE format scenes. The SNAP block takes a Level 1C GRD file and brings it into a format ready for analysis by using a median filter for speck filtering, creating a land-sea mask, and converting the format to a GeoTIFF.

Supported parameters
--------------------

* ``polarisations``: Requested polarisations, either one of
  - [VV, VH]
  - [HH, HV]
  - [VV]
  - [VH]
  - [HV]
  - [HH]
  The operation will fail and give a corresponding error message if the requested polarization is not
  part of the input file.
* ``mask``: It masks either ``land`` or ``sea``. Please note that you can not choose both at the same time.
* ``tcorrection``: It applies Range Doppler Terrain Correction based on a suitable Digital ELevation Model (DEM).

Example
-------

Example using the
:ref:`Sentinel-1 L1C GRD Full Scene block <sentinel1-grd-fullscene-block>` as
data source and then applying SNAP-polarimetric with ``tcorrection``
and masking for ``land``:

                "VV"
            ]
      }
    }


Output format
-------------

AOI.clipped GeoTIFF format. Also in the output file, for each
polarization a separate band will be associated.

Capabilities
------------

The block takes a ``up42.data.scene.sentinel1_l1c_grd`` product and
delivers ``up42.data.aoiclipped``.


Download example output
-----------------------

You can create example output to use when :ref:`testing processing
blocks built to work with this data <custom-processing-block-dev>` by
running the block in a workflow via the :term:`console`, and
downloading the results in the :ref:`job overview <job-overview>`.
