NetCDF -> GeoTIFF Conversion
============================

For more information, please read the `block description <https://marketplace.up42.com/block/e826be64-827b-4df9-b32d-56c528b8050d>`_.

Block type: ``PROCESSING``

NetCDF -> GeoTIFF Conversion converts from the `NetCDF format <https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/data/multidimensional/what-is-netcdf-data.htm>`_ to the ``GeoTIFF`` format. Currently, this block can be used with :ref:`Weather / Ocean Data and Forecasts <meteomatics-block>` by Meteomatics or with the output of :ref:`Sentinel-5P Level-3 Processor <s5p-lvl3-block>` by UP42.

.. warning::

	This block is not compatible with :ref:`Sentinel-5P Full Scenes <sentinel-5p-block>` alone. In order to use this block with :ref:`Sentinel-5P Full Scenes <sentinel-5p-block>`, you need to first convert **Sentinel-5P Level-2** data product into **Sentinel-5P Level-3** data product by using :ref:`Sentinel-5P Level-3 Processor <s5p-lvl3-block>`. The output then will be used as an input for the NetCDF -> GeoTIFF Conversion block.

.. note::

	The bands' structure of the output file depends on the input data structure. In the case of :ref:`Weather / Ocean Data and Forecasts <meteomatics-block>`, the bands are related to the different time steps. For the :ref:`Sentinel-5P Level-3 Processor <s5p-lvl3-block>`, the band is associated with a certain variable.

.. note::

	This block can be used mainly to provide a simple visualization of datasets which were previously in NetCDF format in other geospatial tools such as `QGIS <https://qgis.org/en/site/>`_. For any further analysis, we recommend using the NetCDF format itself.

Example job parameters using the :ref:`Meteomatics <meteomatics-block>` as data source:

.. code-block:: javascript

	{
	"meteomatics:1": {
	"bbox": [
	  13.36967468261719,
	  52.489365859367304,

Example job parameters using the :ref:`Sentinel-5P Full Scenes <sentinel-5p-block>` with :ref:`Sentinel-5P Level-3 Processor <s5p-lvl3-block>`:
