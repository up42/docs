K-means Clustering
==================
Please see the `block details page <https://marketplace.up42.com/block/2ac55313-240d-4a7e-ac47-b7e7786f1f25>`_ for context.

Block type: ``PROCESSING``

This block provides a simple `unsupervised classification <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis>`_ algorithm - K-Means clustering. It will create a set number of classes in each dataset and classify each pixel in one of this classes.

.. warning::
   This block can only process imagery **up to 1.2GB** size, since it requires the entire
   image to be loaded at once into memory. Any imagery with a larger size
   will result in an error.

Supported parameters
--------------------

* ``n_clusters``: The number of clusters for the K-means clustering. Number of classes in the output file. Default is **6**.
* ``n_iterations``: The number of iterations for the K-means clustering. Default is **10**.
* ``n_sieve_pixels``: Minimum number of pixels in each patch or group for the classification. Default is **64**.

Example parameters using the :ref:`SPOT AOIClipped block
<spot-aoiclipped-block>` as data source and then applying the :ref:`K-Means Clustering <kmeans-clustering-block>`:

Output format
-------------
Output and input format are identical. All metadata elements provided by the input dataset as properties are propagated to the output.
