Sentinel-2 Super-resolution
===========================
For more information, please read the `block description <https://marketplace.up42.com/block/f6c29b0a-75bd-44a1-a040-f18c9e881d1d>`_.

Block type: ``PROCESSING``

This block takes an Sentinel-2 L1C MSI Full Scenes image and runs
superresolution algorithm on it. This algorithm creates a 10m
resolution for all the existing spectral bands within 20m and 60m
resolutions by using a trained convolutional neural network.

.. note::

   This block works on a minimum image size of 192x192 pixels. This is
   equivalent to a **minimum area of 4km**:superscript:`2`.

Supported parameters
--------------------

* ``bbox``: The bounding box to use as an AOI. Will clip to scenes that intersect with this box. Use only ``bbox`` **or** ``intersects`` **or** ``contains``.
* ``intersects``: A GeoJSON geometry to use as an AOI. Will clip to scenes that intersect with this geometry. Use only ``bbox`` **or** ``intersects`` **or** ``contains``.
* ``contains``: A GeoJSON geometry to use as an AOI. Will clip to scenes that intersect with this geometry. Use only ``bbox`` **or** ``intersects`` **or** ``contains``.
* ``clip_to_aoi``: When set to ``true``, the area that defined in ``bbox``, ``contains``, or ``intersect`` for previous data block will be clipped for processing. **Note** that by default this parameter is ``false`` which means that the whole scene will be processed.
* ``copy_original_bands``: If set to ``true``,  the original 10m resolution band will also be included in the output image.

Example parameters using the Sentinel:2 L1C MSI Full Scenes block as
data source and then applying s2-superresolution clipped to the specific AOI:

Output format
:::::::::::::

AOI.clipped GeoTIFF format. Also in the output file all the spectral
bands for 20m and 60m will be in 10m spatial resolution.

Download example output
-----------------------

You can create example output to use when :ref:`testing processing
blocks built to work with this data <custom-processing-block-dev>` by
running the block in a workflow via the :term:`console`, and
downloading the results in the :ref:`job overview <job-overview>`.
