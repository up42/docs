Going further with UP42
=======================

If you are already familiar with the topics discussed in the :ref:`introductory
<getting-started>` materials then is time to go further and explore
the :ref:`core concepts <core-concepts>` and understand what
:ref:`data filters <filters>` are available and how they work.


If you are looking into a first run through our API end to end then
take a look at the :ref:`API walkthrough <api-walkthrough>`.
Are you considering developing your first custom block? Then look
:ref:`here <custom-processing-block-dev>`. Might happen that the algorithm
implemented in your processing block benefits from :ref:`using GPUs
<adding-gpu-support-block>`. What about if your block needs
:ref:`credentials <credentials-secrets>` to call an external API or
requires :ref:`custom storage <custom-storage>`?
