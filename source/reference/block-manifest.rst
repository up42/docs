Block manifest
==============

The block manifest defines metadata about the block, and is used to update the block info every time a new version
of the block is pushed.

An example manifest file looks like the following:

.. code:: javascript

   {
     "_up42_specification_version": 2,
     "name": "pansharpen",
     "type": "processing",
     "tags": ["imagery", "processing", "preprocessing"],
     "display_name": "Pan-sharpening SPOT/Pléiades",
     "description": "Pansharpens images from Pléiades or SPOT.",
     "parameters": {
       "method": {
         "type": "string",
         "default": "SFIM"
       },
       "include_pan": {
         "type": "boolean",
         "default": false
       }
     },
     "machine": {
       "type": "large"
     },
     "input_capabilities": {
       "raster": {
         "up42_standard": {
           "format": "DIMAP",
           "sensor": {
             "or": ["Pleiades", "SPOT"]
           },
           "bands": ["red", "green", "blue", "nir", "pan"]
         }
       }
     },
     "output_capabilities": {
       "raster": {
         "up42_standard": {
           "format": "GTiff",
           "bands": {
             "or": [
               ["red", "green", "blue", "nir"],
               ["red", "green", "blue", "nir", "pan"]
             ]
           },
           "sensor": ">",
           "resolution": ">",
           "processing_level": ">",
           "dtype": ">"
         }
       }
     }
   }


The most important keys to note here are the following:

* ``_up42_specification_version``: currently should always be set to ``2``.
* ``name``: the name of your block. This name **must** be unique for your account.
* ``type``: either ``"data"`` or ``"processing"``. This provides a hint to the platform when validating workflows.
  The major difference between data and processing blocks is whether they require input data (data blocks do not
  take any input data, only output it).
* ``tags``: a list of tags used for searching and filtering blocks in the UP42 UI.
* ``display_name``: the name of the block as displayed in the UP42 UI. This name is not checked for
  uniqueness.
* ``description``: free-text explanation of what your block does.
* ``parameters``: for data blocks, the list of all :ref:`query
  parameters <filters>` the block supports. For processing blocks, the
  run-time parameters that your block can optionally specify. See :ref:`the page on parameters <block-params>`
* ``machine``:``type``: defines the computing resource on which the block will be running. You can choose from four predefined machine types:

    * ``small`` (0.5 CPU + 2GB RAM),
    * ``medium`` (1 CPU + 5GB RAM),
    * ``large`` (2 CPU + 10GB RAM),
    * ``xlarge`` (4 CPU + 20GB RAM),
    * ``xxlarge`` (8 CPU + 40GB RAM),
    * ``xxxlarge`` (16 CPU + 80GB RAM).
    * ``gpu_nvidia_tesla_k80`` (4 CPU + 1 GPU + 20GB RAM),
    * ``gpu_p100_xxl`` (8 CPU + 1 GPU + 40GB RAM).

See :ref:`a table <machine-typical-loads>` of typical loads for each machine type.

* ``input_capabilities`` and ``output_capabilities``: the :ref:`capabilities <block-capabilities>` that your block
  requires to run, and/or that it outputs when it is finished. When validating a workflow, every block's output
  capabilties must match exactly the input capabilities of the next block in the workflow. These fields may be
  left empty, although this is not recommended.

Optional Features
-----------------

The manifest file also supports optional features i.e. functionality
that a block can, but not must, support. So far these are only
available for data blocks. See in the following the manifest used for
our built-in Landsat8 block as an example.

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "_up42_specification_version": 2,
     "name": "pleiades-scene",
     "type": "data",
     "tags": ["Airbus", "OneAtlas", "Pléiades", "optical", "global", "high revisit", "very-high resolution"],
     "display_name": "Pléiades Download",
     "description": "Pléiades imagery in its original DIMAP format. RGB, NIR (2 m) and panchromatic (0.5 m) bands with 12 bits.",
     "parameters": {
       "order_ids": {
         "type": "array",
         "default": null
       },
       "ids": {
         "type": "array",
         "default": null
       },
       "bbox": {
         "type": "array",
         "default": null
       },
       "intersects": {
         "type": "geometry"
       },
       "contains": {
         "type": "geometry"
       },
       "time": {
         "type": "dateRange",
         "default": "2018-01-01T00:00:00+00:00/2020-12-31T23:59:59+00:00"
       },
       "limit": {
         "type": "integer",
         "minimum": 1,
         "maximum": 500,
         "default": 1
       },
       "time_series": {
         "type": "array",
         "default": null
       },
       "max_cloud_cover": {
         "type": "integer",
         "minimum": 0,
         "maximum": 100,
         "default": 100
       }
     },
     "machine": {
       "type": "small"
     },
     "optional_features": {
       "quicklook_supported": true,
       "dry_run_supported": true
     },
     "input_capabilities": {},
     "output_capabilities": {
       "raster": {
         "up42_standard": {
           "format": "DIMAP",
           "bands": ["red", "green", "blue", "nir", "pan"],
           "resolution": 0.5,
           "sensor": "Pleiades",
           "dtype": "uint16",
           "processing_level": "l2"
         }
       }
     }
   }

You will notice the ``optional_features``
element. ``quicklook_supported`` indicates that the data block
supports creation of quicklooks as described in :ref:`Data transfer
format <data-transfer-format>`. If ``dry_run_supported`` is set to
``true``, the data block is able to do test runs, i.e. it fetches
information about availability of datasets according to the specified
query parameters without actually fetching any data. See the
UP42_JOB_MODE paragraph in the :ref:`Environmental variables in
running blocks <block-envvars>` section. how this behaviour is
invoked.


Attaching a manifest to a block
-------------------------------

The data in the manifest file needs to be attached as a ``LABEL`` to the docker image. This enables UP42 to read
the manifest quickly, without having to repeatedly fetch entire images.

The easiest way to do this is as follows:

* Keep your manifest as a seperate file, so that it's easier to
  maintain. By convention, we use ``UP42Manifest.json`` in most of the
  documentation.
* In your Dockerfile, add the following lines below the ``FROM``
  directive that sets the base image:

  .. code-block:: docker

      ARG manifest
      LABEL "up42_manifest"=$manifest

* Then, when building the image, specify the contents of the manifest like so:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ docker build . -t <image-tags> --build-arg manifest="$(cat UP42Manifest.json)"

You can then push the block with ``docker push`` as covered in the
:ref:`guide to building custom blocks <build-and-push-first-block>`.


.. _validating-your-manifest:

Validating your manifest
------------------------

Manifests can be validated against the endpoint provided by the platform. With ``curl``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @UP42Manifest.json https://api.up42.com/validate-schema/block

Example valid response:

.. code-block:: text

    Status code: 200
    Body:
    {
        "error": null,
        "data": {
            "valid": true,
            "errors": []
        }
    }

Example invalid response:

.. code-block:: text

    Status code: 400
    Body:
    {
        "error": null,
        "data": {
        "valid": false,
        "errors": [
            "#: required key [name] not found"
        ]
        }
    }

.. tip::

   It is strongly recommended that you validate **always** a block manifest
   **before** pushing it to the UP42 registry.
