Reference documentation
=======================

If you already have a good understanding of the topics discussed in
the :ref:`introduction <getting-started>` and :ref:`going further
<going-further>` sections you are now ready to delve into the
reference documentation for UP42.

A reference is made to be browsed, not read top to bottom: choose a
topic then dive into it to get a deep understanding of that
topic. Repeat as needed and/or desired. The section titles are
self-explanatory.
