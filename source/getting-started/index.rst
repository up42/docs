   The UP42 Platform

You start by signing up and creating an UP42 account. This step will
allow you to open the demo project, which contains the demo
workflow. The demo workflow is a combination of data and processing
blocks. These blocks are UP42 units that point to a specific
geospatial data acquisition and processing algorithm. Finally, the
workflow is being run as a job to generate results.
