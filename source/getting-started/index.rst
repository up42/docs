   The UP42 Console

We start with :ref:`exploring <first-job-run>` the very first
:term:`job` that is automatically run once you confirm your UP42
account. Proceed by :ref:`creating <build-first-workflow>` your own
first workflow. Then take a sneek peek into more advanced topics like
:ref:`running a job via the API <first-api-request>` and/or experiment with your first
:ref:`custom block <first-custom-block>`.
