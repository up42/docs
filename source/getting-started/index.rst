   The UP42 Platform

You start by signing up and creating an UP42 account. This step will allow you to open the demo project, which contains the demo workflow. The demo workflow is a combination of data and processing blocks. These blocks are UP42 units that point to a specific geospatial data acquisition and processing algorithm. Finally, the workflow is being run as a job to generate results.
