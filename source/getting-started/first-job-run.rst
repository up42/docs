====================
Run your first job
====================

This section will guide you through running your first job on the UP42
platform using a simple demo project that calculates an :term:`NDVI` Vegetation Index.

The UP42 console
-----------------

When you login to the UP42 website you get to the :term:`console`, the
central workspace of UP42. It allows you to create
:term:`projects<project>`, use data and processing
:term:`blocks<block>` to put together custom
:term:`workflows<workflow>` and run them as :term:`jobs<job>`.

Explore the Demo project
------------------------

We created a simple **Demo Project** for you to explore. The project
page contains the **Demo Workflow** made up of one :term:`data block`
for the Pléiades satellite imagery and two :term:`processing blocks <processing block>`
for the pansharpening and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We
already ran the workflow for you, explore the results in the **Jobs** section.

This demo workflow takes a **satellite image** recorded by the :ref:`Pléiades
<pleiades-download-block>` sensor and clips it to an :term:`area of interest
(AOI)<AOI>` near Christchurch, New Zealand. Pléiades data has five bands, the
first four are Blue, Green, Red and Near-Infrared (NIR), at 2m resolution.
It also has a panchromatic band with 0.5m resolution that can be used to
:ref:`pansharpen <pansharpen-block>` the other four bands, bringing their resolution to
0.5m, as well. The third and final block of the workflow calculates the
NDVI, a very commonly used vegetation index which is an indicator of biomass
and vegetation health.

Run your first job
-------------------

In order to run a job on your own, just click the ``Rerun Job`` button
at the top of the :ref:`Job overview<job-overview>` page. This will
instantiate the **Demo Workflow**, after a brief moment the status
will change from **pending** to **successful**.

Congratulations! Your are ready to learn more about UP42 in the
:ref:`Building your first workflow<build-first-workflow>` section!

A final note: the used :ref:`Pléiades DIMAP Download <pleiades-download-block>`
block is run using the ``order_ids`` parameter. This means you can re-use this
particular satellite image free of charge indefinitely! See the
:ref:`Download blocks tutorial<download-blocks-tutorial-spot-pleiades>` to
learn how that works.
