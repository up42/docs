==================================
 How to get started in using UP42
==================================

There are multiple possible paths for you through the documentation,
depending what is your intent and what sort of customer you are. Below
there are suggestions on how to navigate the documentation based on
what type of customer you are. These are merely indicative and
certainly most of the times a customer might straddle all four
customer profiles described here.

.. _path-analyst:

 * I am an **analyst** and I want to use UP42 to perform diverse types
   of analysis to get some geospatial insights. In that case please follow this path:

   + Build your :ref:`first workflow <build-first-workflow>`.
   + Look for data using :ref:`catalog search <catalog-search>`.
   + Look for data using a :ref:`test query <test-query>`.
   + See what are the `data sources <https://marketplace.up42.com/search?type=DATA>`_
     (:ref:`technical documentation <up42-data-blocks-documentation>`) available in UP42.
   + See what are the `algorithms <https://marketplace.up42.com/search?type=PROCESSING>`_
     (:ref:`technical documentation <up42-processing-blocks-documentation>`) available in UP42.
   + Explore specific data blocks like the :ref:`download blocks for
     Pléiades/SPOT <download-blocks-tutorial-spot-pleiades>`.
   + Explore UP42 inside a `Jupyter notebook <https://jupyter.org>`_ using the `Python
     SDK <https://sdk.up42.com>`_.

.. _path-developer:

 * I am a **developer** and I'm aiming to do a product integration
   with UP42. Please follow this path:

   + Do you first :ref:`API request <first-api-request>`.
   + See what are the `data sources
     <https://marketplace.up42.com/search?type=DATA>`_
     (:ref:`technical documentation <up42-data-blocks-documentation>`) available in UP42.
   + See what are the `algorithms <https://marketplace.up42.com/search?type=PROCESSING>`_
     (:ref:`technical documentation <up42-processing-blocks-documentation>`) available in UP42.
   + Explore the API further using the `Python SDK <https://sdk.up42.com>`_.
   + Explore the raw API using just a shell and standard UNIX tools
     like `cURL <https://curl.haxx.se>`__  and `jq <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/>`__
     by following the :ref:`API walkthrough <api-walkthrough>`.
   + Get an overview of what the UP42 API has to offer by looking at the
     :ref:`API reference <api-specification>`.

.. _path-custom-block:

 * I am an **algorithm developer** and I want to run my own
   algorithms in UP42. Then this is the suggested path:

   + How to get started in
     :ref:`developing your custom processing block <custom-processing-block-dev>`.
   + See what are the `data sources <https://marketplace.up42.com/search?type=DATA>`_
     (:ref:`technical documentation <up42-data-blocks-documentation>`) available in UP42.
   + See what are the `algorithms <https://marketplace.up42.com/search?type=PROCESSING>`_
   + How to make use of :ref:`GPUs <custom-processing-block-dev>`
     available in UP42 to speed up your algorithms.
   + How to use :ref:`custom data <custom-storage>` in your processing
     block.
   + How to share :ref:`credentials and secrets <credentials-secrets>` in your blocks.
   + Explore the `Python block utilities
     <https://blockutils.up42.com>`_ to hit the ground running in
     terms of building UP42 blocks.
   + See examples of block implementations in our :ref:`FLOSS blocks <floss-blocks>`
     (**F**\ree/**L**\ibre **O**\pen **S**\ource **S**\oftware).

.. _path-beginner:

 * I am a **beginner** in geospatial analysis. Where should I start? Here
   is a path that, hopefully, gets you up & running with using UP42 to
   derive geospatial insights.

   + Watch the :ref:`videos tutorials <video-tutorials>` in how to use UP42.
   + Build your :ref:`first workflow <build-first-workflow>`.
   + Look for data using :ref:`catalog search <catalog-search>`.
   + Look for data using a :ref:`test query <test-query>`.
   + See what are the `data sources <https://marketplace.up42.com/search?type=DATA>`_
     (:ref:`technical documentation <up42-data-blocks-documentation>`) available in UP42.
   + See what are the `algorithms <https://marketplace.up42.com/search?type=PROCESSING>`_
     (:ref:`technical documentation <up42-processing-blocks-documentation>`) available in UP42.
   + Explore specific data blocks like the :ref:`download blocks for
     Pléiades/SPOT <download-blocks-tutorial-spot-pleiades>`.
   + Explore UP42 inside a `Jupyter notebook <https://jupyter.org>`_ using the `Python
     SDK <https://sdk.up42.com>`_.
   + Do you first :ref:`API request <first-api-request>`.
   + Explore the raw API using just a shell and standard UNIX tools
     like `cURL <https://curl.haxx.se>`__  and `jq <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/>`__
