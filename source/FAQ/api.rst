API FAQ
=======

Does UP42 have an API?
----------------------

Yes. We are a developer focused company, so you can think of the API as
our **main** product.

What can be done through the API?
---------------------------------

Using the project key available at
``https://console.up42.com/projects/<project_id>/settings``, where
``<project_id>`` is your project assigned
`UUID <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier>`__,
you can do everything within the project:

1. Add/remove blocks, thus modifying the workflow.
2. Create, run, cancel jobs.
3. And much, much more: see the :ref:`API walkthrough <api-walkthrough>` or the :ref:`API reference <api-specification>`.

Where can I learn more about the UP42 API?
------------------------------------------

To learn more about our API and the concepts underlying it go to our
:ref:`documentation <api-walkthrough>` or maybe you prefer to dive into the :ref:`API reference <api-specification>`.


Are there any limitations to using the UP42 API?
------------------------------------------------

Yes. Please consult our :ref:`API usage constraints <api-usage-constraints>` reference.
