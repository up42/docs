 Compliance FAQ
================

Why do I need to undergo a KYC check?
=====================================

In order to comply with the UP42 regulations (in particular regarding Anti-Money Laundering laws), but also due to the nature of the data/algorithms accessible on the platform, UP42 is authorized to perform a Know Your Customer (KYC) check of users (individuals and/or businesses).

Depending on the data, the financial amount invested on the platform but also the tasks requested, the level of control can be different.

Do I need to provide any additional data for the KYC check?
===========================================================

According to your use of the platform, the degree of KYC is likely to be different and therefore requires the examination of specific documentation.

If additional documentation or information is needed, our compliance officer will contact you.

Who will access my additional data during the KYC check?
========================================================

Your additional data will be processed through our internal compliance tools, in order to validate the information provided. The usage of this data outside of this purpose is strictly prohibited.

What is the duration of a KYC check?
====================================

The duration of a KYC check varies on a case-by-case basis from a few hours to a few weeks. In some cases, additional data from the users is required.

How can I know more about KYC checks?
=====================================
