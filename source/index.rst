Here you can find comprehensive information on how to use UP42 in all
its aspects and find quick & easy entry points into our
documentation.

First steps
-----------

Use the :term:`console` to run your first job, then learn how to
create a workflow. Finally, run a job via the API.

+ |first-job| :ref:`Run your first UP42 job <first-job-run>`
+ |first-workflow| :ref:`Your first workflow <build-first-workflow>`
+ |first-api| :ref:`Your first API request <first-api-request>`

Going further
-------------

Now that you know the basics, grasp the concepts and terminology
specific to UP42. How to query for data: what filters are available.
Walkthrough the API: get an overview of what can be done via the API.

Introduction to running your own code
-------------------------------------

If you are looking into **developing** a processing algorithm and/or
use your own data sources, then start your journey into it by
experimenting with our demo processing block, offered as free software
on `Github
<https://github.com/up42/land-cover-classification-demo>`_. Learn how
to develop **your own** processing block and, if need be, make use of
GPUs to speed it up.

+ |first-block| :ref:`Push your first block <first-custom-block>`
+ |develop-block| :ref:`Develop your block <custom-processing-block-dev>`
+ |gpu-block| :ref:`Use GPUs in your block <adding-gpu-support-block>`
